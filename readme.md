## Concepts and Examples

### 1. Data Handling
- **Data Loading**: Learn to import datasets from CSV, Excel, or APIs using libraries like `pandas`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Preprocessing steps like normalization, encoding categorical features, and scaling.

### 2. Supervised Learning
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to neighbors.
- **Decision Trees**: Visual tree-based models for classification and regression tasks.
- **Random Forests**: An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **SVM**: A robust classifier that separates data with hyperplanes.
- **Logistic Regression**: Predict probabilities and classify data into binary categories.

### 3. Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering**: Group similar data points into clusters based on their features.
- **PCA**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving maximum variance.

### 4. Regression Techniques
- **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous variables based on input features.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Capture non-linear relationships using polynomial terms.

### 5. Advanced Models
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm for both classification and regression.
- **Deep Learning**: Implement Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to handle complex datasets.
