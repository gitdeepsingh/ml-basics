# Simple Linear Regression (SLR)

Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and a single independent variable (X). The goal is to find the linear equation that best predicts the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable.

## Equation
The equation of a simple linear regression model is:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon \]

Where:
- \( Y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the y-intercept (constant term).
- \( \beta_1 \) is the slope of the regression line (coefficient of the independent variable).
- \( X \) is the independent variable.
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

## Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression

1. **Linearity**:
   - The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is linear.

2. **Independence**:
   - The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.

3. **Homoscedasticity**:
   - The residuals have constant variance at every level of \( X \).

4. **Normality**:
   - The residuals of the model are normally distributed.

5. **No Multicollinearity**:
   - The independent variable is not perfectly correlated with another variable.

6. **No Autocorrelation**:
   - There should be no autocorrelation in the residuals.

## Important Concepts

### 1. **Linearity**
- The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is assumed to be linear.

### 2. **Independence**
- The residuals (errors) are assumed to be independent of each other.

### 3. **Homoscedasticity**
- The residuals have constant variance across all levels of the independent variable.

### 4. **Normality**
- The residuals of the model are normally distributed.

### 5. **No Multicollinearity**
- The independent variable is not perfectly correlated with another variable.

### 6. **No Autocorrelation**
- There should be no autocorrelation in the residuals.

## Applications
Simple Linear Regression is widely used in various fields for predictive modeling and trend analysis. Some common applications include:
- **Economics**: Forecasting economic indicators, such as inflation rates.
- **Finance**: Predicting stock prices and financial returns.
- **Healthcare**: Analyzing the relationship between a patient's age and their health outcomes.
- **Marketing**: Assessing the impact of advertising spend on sales.
- **Environmental Science**: Studying the effect of temperature on ice cream sales.
